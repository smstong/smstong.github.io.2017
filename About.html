<p>
My name is Jonathan ZHAO. I am a system administrator and programmer living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Before immigrating to Canada in 2016, I lived in Dalian which is a beautiful city located in the northen China.

My IT life began in 2002 when I was a college student and soon I realized that COMPUTER would become an 
important part of my life. While I always have passion on everything related to computers, what really 
attracts me is the Linux OS and Internet. What I believe is the more details you know, the more confidence
 you will have.
