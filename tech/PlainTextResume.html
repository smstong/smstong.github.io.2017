<h1>How to write and print a PLAIN TEXT resume?</h1>
<p>
A plain text resume is perfect for IT workers.
It needs some skills to write and print plain text resumes.
</p>
<h2>Page setting and font selection</h2>
<p>
The most common paper in North America is Letter which is the most acceptable 
paper for resumes. The Letter's size is (W)215.9mm X (H)279.4mm. For a resume,
the proper side margin is 1 inch(2.54cm). So, the valid width for resume content
is 215.9-25.4*2 = 165.1mm.
</p>
<p>
Since the paper settings are fixed, it's time to choose a proper font family for
our resumes. As the resume contains only PLAIN TEXT, monospaced(every character has
the same width) font is a must.As for me, "Courier" is my best choice.

</p>
<p>
Next, we should determine the right font size. Many people suggest that the best font
 size for a resume is 10pt-14pt. According to the suggestion, I choose Courier 12pt.
An important thing worth knowing is that the font size is very different from the font
 width. When is comes to Courier, font width is about font size multiplying 0.6. As a 
 result, the Courier 12pt font's width is actually 12*0.6=7.2pt=7.2 * (25.4/72)mm=2.54mm.
Then we can calculate how many characters can one line contain: 165.1mm / 2.54mm = 65.
</p>
<p>
As an hacker programmer, you may be used to the the 80x24 screen size. A Letter paper is
 absolutely different from a screen. So don't write 80(more bigger than 65) characters in one line.
</p>
<p>
As a computer worker, we often like 64(2^6) more than 65. Finally, I choose 64 as the maximum
 characters in one line.
</p>

<h2>Print to a Paper Resume</h2>
<p>
Right now, I can email my PLAIN TEXT resume everywhere as long as a 
monospaced font is selected when sending the email. But I also need a 
physically printed resume which can be brought with me for the future 
interview. The request for printing is coming.
</p>
<h3>Directly printing by lpr/lp</h3>
<p>
Most linux systems now support cups and lp/lpr commands. Since a plain text
 file contains only text without any format information such as font and
 page setting, the format information must be given as options of the lp/lpr
  command.
<pre>
lp -o media=Letter \
   -o page-left=72 \
   -o page-top=72 \
   -cpi=10 \
   -lpi=6 \
   resume.txt
</pre>
</p>
<p>
NOTE: -cpi=10 #characters per inch(25.4mm/2.54mm=10) 
</p>
<h3>Converting to pdf before printing</h3>
<p>
If sometimes I cannot use my lovely Linux to print my resume, what should I do?
Today even mobile phones can be used to connect to a printer. So, a file able to 
be printed through all devices is my target. 
</p>
<p>
PDF, as the most protable file format, can not only provide the same view for all
 screens, but also for printers. Before printing my resume, converting it to a pdf 
 format file is a really good choice.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of tools used to generate a pdf file from a plain text file. As my 
linux OS is CentOS, I only show the built-in tools here. We need 2 apps, enscript
(in ghostscript package) and ps2pdf(in enscript package). 
"enscript" is responsible for converting txt to postscript, while "ps2pdf" is 
responsible for converting postscript to pdf.
</p>
<p>
The following cmdline generates resume.ps from resume.txt.
<pre>
enscript --no-header \
	--margins=72:72:72:72 \
	--font=Courier12 \
	--media=Letter \
	--output=resume.ps \
	resume.txt
</pre>

</p>
<p>
NOTE: --margins=left,right,top,bottom<br/>
--font=Courier12: font name Courier, font size 12pt.<br/>
The following cmdline converts resume.ps to resume.pdf.

</p>
<p>
<pre>
ps2pdf resume.ps resume.pdf
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now we have the resume.pdf! Printing a pdf file is so easy in all softwares, including 
Adobe Reader available for almost all devices, and lp/lpr. In fact, using lpr to print 
a pdf file is exremely simple!
<pre>
lp resume.pdf
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Because the resume.pdf is ready, besides printing, it can be emailed as an attachment to anyone.
